# Dotfiles

This repository is forked from [mastertinner/dotfiles](https://github.com/mastertinner/dotfiles) and customized with my configurations.

I mainly work with [Go](https://golang.org), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [shell scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) so my setup is geared towards working with these technologies.

Automated setup is supported for macOS and Arch Linux (and its derivates). Other Linux distributions should work but have to be set up manually.

## Features and Usage

### Terminal

This setup uses a powerful combination of [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) and [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) with a very minimalistic prompt.

- `pacu`: Update and upgrade the whole system (using `Brewfile` on macOS)
- `depu`: Update and upgrade the dependencies for the current project
- `ctrl + n` and `crtl + p`: Cycle through the last used commands filtering by what was already typed
- `gopass`: Trigger the password manager

### IDE

[NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) configured to be an IDE. The whole setup with all plugins can also be run as a [Docker Container](https://github.com/mastertinner/vide).

- `v`: Start Neovim with all plugins
- `ctrl + p`: Fuzzy search across whole project
- `ctrl + n`: Visual file explorer

## Installation

1. Clone this repo to `~/dotfiles` by running `git clone git@github.com:mastertinner/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles`
1. Change the name and email address in `git/.gitconfig`
1. macOS only: Change `Brewfile` to your liking or add `extra.Brewfile` for independent packages per machine
1. macOS only: If you have apps installed which you didn't install through `brew cask` but that you now added to `Brewfile` as `cask`, you need to reinstall them with `brew cask install <name> --force` so `cask` knows it's supposed to manage these apps.

   Note: This won't delete any of your data. The app will just be reinstalled with `brew cask` and everything will be back to normal once the installation script has run.

1. Run `~/dotfiles/install.sh`

   **WARNING: This may install and/or remove software and change your configs!**

1. Either import an existing PGP key pair by using `gpg --import my-key.asc` and `gpg --import my-key-pub.asc` or create a new one by following the [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key) guide. You need to use the same name and email address as an ID that you have configured in `git/.gitconfig` in order to correctly sign your commits.
1. Either import an existing SSH key pair by copying it to `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` or create a new one by following the [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) guide.
